# Quiz Game

A simple and interactive Quiz Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was created as a personal exercise to get comfortable with full stack development concepts and hands-on coding.

## Features
- Multiple-choice questions with instant feedback
- Animated progress bar to track quiz completion
- Responsive and modern UI inspired by a YouTube design (all code written from scratch)
- Score tracking and dynamic end screen with personalized messages
- Option to restart the quiz and try again

## How It Works
- The user starts the quiz by clicking the "Start Quiz" button.
- Each question is displayed with several answer options.
- When an answer is selected, feedback is given and the next question appears after a short delay.
- The progress bar smoothly fills as you advance through the quiz.
- At the end, your score and a motivational message are shown, with an option to restart.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the quiz and UI elements
- **CSS**: Custom styles for a clean, modern look (UI layout inspired by a YouTube design, but all CSS written by me)
- **JavaScript**: Handles quiz logic, question flow, scoring, and UI interactivity

## Purpose
This project was built to practice and strengthen my skills in:
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling
- Responsive design
- State management in JavaScript

## Credits
- **UI Inspiration**: Design layout and color scheme inspired by a YouTube tutorial (all code is original and self-written)
